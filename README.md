## Benchmark UI
This repo contains a simple script for creating custom plots for the latest benchmark results from my tests for the MI300A compute nodes on the UC3 and FTP clusters. It uses streamlit to create a modern web app.

## How to run it locally
1. Create a python venv and activate it
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
3. Start the UI with `streamlit run main.py`
